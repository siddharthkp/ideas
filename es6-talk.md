### Purpose

ES6/ES2015 is the present. Its already in browser implementation and the TC39 team is moving at good pace to add more features to the JavaScript language.
Relatively low learning curve and babel/polyfills guarantee no extra effort to support older browsers.The newer features being added are building upon the features present in ES2015.
Its a good idea to be using it in your projects now and try to include it in your old projects when refactoring or adding new features.

### Outline
